# Node-Stream
A super simple, super basic node js based self hosted streaming service.


## Installation
1. `npm install`
2. Remove the `.example` from the `config.json` and edit if wanted but shouldn't be necessary
3. Remove the `.example` from the `movies.json` and edit it by inserting all the movies you want available
4. `node index.js`
5. open web browser at `localhost:8080`

## Plans
 - Password login
 - Custom player controls
 - Subtitle support (yes, it's there but the files aren't hosted correctly yet)
 - Upload/modify page
 - Video conversion (currently all videos must be mp4)
 - Add series support
